start
i need to read the file by using:

os.Open the file will be a var of type *os.File which is way to access the content

then reading by bufio.NewScanner which return a *bufio.NewScanner var 

now we do a for (name of the var u stored the bufio.NewScanner).Scan(){

after that we need to store the content of each line with each itration like so{
	(a var with any name) := (the var that stored the  *bufio.NewScanner ).Text()
	this will return a string var.
}

 we need a var to access the main struct(antFarm) 
 var (any name) antFarm
 for me its (farmInfo)

 we check the first line by the len if len(line) == 1 that means we are on the first line
 which have the the number of ants int in the file called examples
 we convert that line into int and store it in a var  then do
 a simple  farmInfo.Ants = (name of your var)
 now u have the number of ants stored 
}

{we need to check for the start and the end }
	which i will do later

else if line Contains " " we split the line by " " we store in var called parts
0. will be the room name and 1.2 will be X-Y which we need to convet to int to store them 
	convert the parts[1] and [2] to int calle them (x) (y) small letters

we make a var to access the Room struct like this
(any name ):= (Room struct NAme){
	Name : parts [0]
	Location :Location [X:x,Y:y] since  my room struct have another location struct  
}

now u just neef to append it like so 
farmInfo.Rooms = appemd (farmInfo.Rooms,(same name))
 
(this is better then the func we used in project 4)

for tunnels split them by "-" and followe the same steps as before

if evrything is good u should see this in the terminal
{4   [{0 {0 3}} {2 {2 5}} {3 {4 0}} {1 {8 3}}] [{0 2} {2 3} {3 1}]}
antNum           room names and locations      tunnels and pathes
